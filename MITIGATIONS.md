# SAFE-MCP Mitigations Reference

## About SAFE-MCP Mitigations

SAFE-MCP mitigations are security controls designed to protect Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations from the attack techniques documented in our framework. Each mitigation is categorized by type and effectiveness, with clear mappings to the techniques it addresses.

### Mitigation Categories

- **Architectural Defense**: Fundamental design patterns that prevent entire classes of attacks
- **Cryptographic Control**: Security measures using cryptographic techniques
- **AI-Based Defense**: Controls leveraging AI/ML for detection and prevention
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization and validation of inputs before processing
- **Supply Chain Security**: Controls for securing the MCP software supply chain
- **UI Security**: Controls ensuring visual consistency and preventing deception
- **Isolation and Containment**: Sandboxing and isolation techniques
- **Detective Control**: Monitoring and detection capabilities
- **Preventive Control**: Controls that prevent attacks before they occur
- **Architectural Control**: System design patterns for security

### Effectiveness Ratings

- **High**: Highly effective control, prevents 80%+ of targeted attacks
- **Medium-High**: Effective control, prevents 60-80% of targeted attacks
- **Medium**: Moderately effective, prevents 40-60% of targeted attacks
- **Low**: Limited effectiveness, prevents <40% of targeted attacks

## Implementation Guidance

### Defense in Depth Strategy

The most effective security posture combines multiple mitigations across different categories:

1. **Foundation Layer**: Implement architectural defenses (SAFE-M-1, SAFE-M-21) that provide fundamental protection
2. **Prevention Layer**: Add cryptographic controls (SAFE-M-2) and input validation (SAFE-M-4, SAFE-M-5, SAFE-M-22)
3. **Detection Layer**: Deploy monitoring and detection controls (SAFE-M-10, SAFE-M-11, SAFE-M-12)
4. **Response Layer**: Maintain audit logs and incident response procedures

### Priority Implementation

For organizations with limited resources, prioritize implementation based on:

1. **Critical Controls** (Implement First):
   - SAFE-M-1: Control/Data Flow Separation
   - SAFE-M-2: Cryptographic Integrity
   - SAFE-M-6: Tool Registry Verification
   - SAFE-M-11: Behavioral Monitoring

2. **Important Controls** (Implement Second):
   - SAFE-M-3: AI-Powered Content Analysis
   - SAFE-M-4: Unicode Sanitization
   - SAFE-M-9: Sandboxed Testing
   - SAFE-M-13: OAuth Flow Verification

3. **Additional Controls** (Implement as Resources Allow):
   - Remaining mitigations based on specific threat model


## Usage Guidelines

- Review mitigations relevant to your threat model
- Implement controls in layers for defense in depth
- Regularly update and test mitigation effectiveness
- Monitor for new threats requiring additional controls
- Consider automation for detective controls
- Document implementation details for compliance
